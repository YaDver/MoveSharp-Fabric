# MoveSharp - Enhanced Movement in Minecraft

## About the Mod

MoveSharp expands the basic movement mechanics in Minecraft by adding new ways to interact with vertical surfaces. The mod is inspired by the concepts behind programming languages C++ and C#, aiming to improve and complement existing mods that offer similar functionalities. This inspiration is reflected in the mod's name, MoveSharp (or Move#). MoveSharp adds additional conditions, limitations, and details for a more realistic and engaging gameplay experience.

## Mod Mechanics

*   **Climbing:** Hold down the sprint button (Ctrl by default) and jump towards a wall up to 4 blocks high to climb it.
*   **Sliding:** While falling, press against a wall and hold down the sneak button (Shift by default) to grab onto the wall and reduce your fall speed. This helps minimize fall damage!
*   **Crawling:** Hold down the sprint button (Ctrl by default) and press the sneak button (Shift by default) while on the ground to crouch and crawl through a 1-block high tunnel.
*   **Automatic Crawl Mode:** When a player climbs a wall where there is no space underneath their character (1 block high instead of two), the character will automatically switch to crawl mode to climb through a narrow opening in the wall.
*   **Utilizing Existing Keybinds:** The mod does not create new keybindings. It utilizes the sprint and sneak keys from the standard Minecraft control settings.

## Limitations

*   **Fall Height:** You cannot grab onto a wall for sliding or climbing if you are falling more than 5 blocks high.
*   **Repeated Use:**  You cannot reuse these mechanics until you have landed.

## Minecraft Version Support

*   1.20.1 (Fabric)

## Future Plans

* **Porting to Other Fabric Versions**: Initially, the mod will be ported to newer versions, and then I'll work on porting it to older ones as well.
